# MRJP Projects

This repository contains my projects from the course "Methods of Programming
Languages Realisation".

## Overview

MRJP stands for "Metody Realizacji Języków Programowania" in Polish, which
translates to "Methods of Programming Languages Realisation". This repository
includes my projects from this course, all of which are implemented in Haskell.

## Project Descriptions

Below are brief descriptions of the projects:

1. **Instant Compiler**: Instant is a simple programming language that supports
variable assignments with arithmetic expressions and printing expressions. This
project includes compilers for both LLVM and JVM, though neither of them
performs any optimisations.

2. **Latte Compiler**: Latte is a Java-based programming language. The goal of
this project was to implement an LLVM compiler for Latte, covering parsing,
typechecking, and code generation, along with some basic optimisations. The
parser was generated using BNFC.

More details can be found in the respective project directories.
